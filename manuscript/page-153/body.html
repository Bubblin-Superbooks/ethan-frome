Only I—” He pushed his plate away, rose from his chair, and walked around the table to her side. She started up with frightened eyes.</p><p>“Ethan, there's something wrong! I knew there was!”</p><p>She seemed to melt against him in her terror, and he caught her in his arms, held her fast there, felt her lashes beat his cheek like netted butterflies.</p><p>“What is it—what is it?” she stammered; but he had found her lips at last and was drinking unconsciousness of everything but the joy they gave him.</p><p>She lingered a moment, caught in the same strong current; then she slipped from him and drew back a step or two, pale and troubled. Her look smote him with compunction, and he cried out, as if he saw her drowning in a dream: “You can't go, Matt! I'll never let you!”</p></div> </div>
